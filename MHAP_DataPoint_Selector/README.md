# MHap Analysis Data Selection App

This app facilitates data selection for MHap Analysis in Terra. It compiles ASVs and defines the analysis timeframe for Micro Haplotype Analyses.

It was designed by Jorge Eduardo Amaya Romero for use with the MHap\_Analysis workflow in Terra and is available here [WEBSITEPLACEHOLDER].

2. **Upload Metadata File:** Upload metadata to generate time stamp checkboxes.
